This project is still ongoing, thus the readme is not completed. 

The network is based on the NEAT methology. Basically evolution where we randomize the weights 
in the network and mutate the best performing one based on a few different parameters. 

Either picking the best one or calculating the mean of the top performing cars
To run tha simuklator, run following: 
```
python3 car_game/game.py
```
